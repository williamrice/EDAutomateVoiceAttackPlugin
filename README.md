# This application no longer works as designed due to changes in Elite Dangerous and Inara. I've lost interest in Elite Dangerous and have no intentions on updating this repository at the moment

# EDAutomateVoiceAttackProgram
## This plugin is under development and is in a very alpha state as new features are being added
A voice attack plug in to automate external elite programs such as pulling up inara directly to commodity, engineer, or module information. It is designed for use with OVR Drop in VR so you can open the external windows by voice command and never leave the headset or type anything.

# Installation
Unzip to your Voice Attack/Apps folder. 
See the Install Instructions(READ ME).pdf included in the download if you need more help installing.

## Current commands
See the user guide included in the download


## Usage Tips
+ Once a browser window is spawned, it is best to leave it open in the background for best results. If you close the browser tab or the chromewebdriver, you will receive a slight delay on the next browser automation command. This is due to the timeout that the chromewebdriver has. I've yet to find a solution for this and neither has the internet. The webdriver has no way of knowing that the window was exited. I will only allow one instance of the webdriver to be launched for obvious performance reasons. Your best bet is to leave the opened webbrowser and chromewebdriver running in the background after the first command as you play.
